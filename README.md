# MSP430FR6989 Digital Clock System ‚è∞

## Overview üìù

This project implements a digital clock system using the MSP430FR6989 microcontroller. It combines both C and Assembly language programming to create an efficient, low-power digital timekeeper with interactive features. The clock displays time in HH:MM:SS format on the integrated LCD screen of the MSP430FR6989 development board, and includes visual indicators like battery animation and status LEDs.

The system operates in two main modes:
- **Visual Mode**: Displays the current time with blinking separator dots
- **Edit Mode**: Allows time adjustment using keyboard input with LED indicators for feedback

The architecture uses a task-based approach where different functions handle specific aspects of the system (clock management, LED control, battery animation, etc.) running on a cooperative multitasking framework.

## Project Goals üéØ 

- Demonstrate hybrid programming using both C and Assembly language
- Create a functional digital clock with user interface capabilities

## System Architecture üîÑ

The system is organized into separate tasks that handle different aspects of the clock:

- **tareaReloj()**: Updates and displays the time
- **tareaTeclado()**: Processes keyboard input for time setting
- **tareaBateria()**: Manages the battery animation display
- **tareaPuntos()**: Controls the blinking of separator dots
- **tareaLed()**: Manages LED indicators (active in edit mode)

All tasks operate on a cooperative scheduling model based on timer interrupts, with the system entering low-power mode (LPM3) between task executions.
